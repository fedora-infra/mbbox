Welcome to the mbbox development environment!

Here are some tips:

* The code is located at ~/devel/

* Dev environment is set for the development of ansible based operator for OpenShift, for more info look at https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/operators/operator_sdk/osdk-ansible.html

* To test the operator in the containerized kubernetes cluster
  # This command runs automated E2E (end to end) tests in the containerized kubernetes cluster
  $ molecule test -s test-local

* To deploy and run the mbox operator in the local kubernetes cluster:
  # First you need to start the minikube cluster and enable the ingress addon
  $ minikube start
  $ minikube addons enable ingress

  # To prevent issues in docker network setup of minikube
  $ minikube ssh
  $ sudo ip link set docker0 promisc on

  # Build the image and upload it to quay (optional) (you need to be in ~/devel/mbox-operator)
  # This needs to be done every time you made a change to the operator code
  # You may also need to update the IMG variable in mbox-operator/Makefile
  $ docker build -t quay.io/username/mbbox-operator:tag .
  $ docker push quay.io/username/mbbox-operator:tag

  # Create the mbbox-operator requirements to the local kubernetes cluster
  # This needs to be done only once unless there was a change in any of those resources
  $ make install
  
  # Deploy the operator
  $ make deploy

  # Deploy rabbitmq and postgreSQL (you need to be in the ~/devel directory)
  $ kubectl apply -f components/rabbitmq -n default
  $ kubectl apply -f components/psql -n default

  # Deploy the operator CRDs (you need to be in ~/devel/mbox-operator)
  $ kustomize build config/samples | kubectl apply -f -

  Congratulations! MBBox is now running inside 'default' namespace.

* To destroy the minikube cluster
  $ minikube delete

* To debug kubernetes deployment here are a few tips
  $ kubectl get all - help you see what is currently in kubernetes cluster
  $ kubectl describe pod/<name> - will give you some overview
  $ kubectl logs pod/<name> <container> - will show you logs of the pod

Happy hacking!
